# About
Hello, welcome to my blog. So you have come to this page to find out more about me.
That's so nice of you! Unfortunately, there is nothing special about me -
I'm just your average person getting by the world while also enjoy writing about
my thoughts on what I learn about the world in this blog.
If there is anything I can tell you I guess that would be: I like anime, manga,
light novel and all that stuff. I also enjoy writting code for stuff, sometime.

This about page is written in English, but my content may be written in
other languages such as my native tongue - Vietnamese, or a language that I have
been studying - Japanese (I do not think I'm anywhere qualified enough to write any
intelligible Japanese though). I try to choose the post's written language to
best suit the intended audiences: it wouldn't make much sense for me to write posts
about programming languages in Vietnamese and having to translate every other terms
nor it would make much sense for me to review a Vietnamese book for my Vietnamese
friends in English.

I want to keep this blog somewhat personal, to write all the thoughts I want to
broadcast to the world via this blog. There is no intention of advertising or
commercial purpose whatsoever. However, if you like whatever I write here and
wish to share them, please feel free to do so. It would make me happy to know
my blog somehow manages to be interesting enough to influence others.

About the contruction of this blog, it uses [zola](https://www.getzola.org/),
a static site generator engine written in Rust, combined with their free
[even](https://www.github.com/Keats/even) theme with some minor adjustments
to make the site easier for me to work with, or have some more features that I like.

There is no commenting feature on this blog. This is intended as I have stated
above this blog is merely a convenient for me write all my thoughts in one place.
