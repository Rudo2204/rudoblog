Initially I wanted to write about random stuff I have cooked up each week as a journal
of some kind. However, this turns out to be not a great idea. There are a few problems
with this approach:
1. I mostly write random tools here and there. I can certainly talk about them and what
they do, but to actually document the whole process of building them is another completely
different beast. In order to make it interesting you would have to plan out the structure
of the blog beforehand, maybe as a educational blog as some kind, and then write your
program accordingly to that structure.

Unfortunately, this does not work well for me. When I write something, it's usually
a completely new experience for me. There are a ton of problems that I have to read the docs,
research about it, test it out before I can actually begin to implement them. You may say:
"But yes! That's the whole point of a educational blog!". But to me, in order to teach something,
you must know at least 3 times as much of the stuff you are writing about. This does not apply
to a short write-up about a neat thing you learnt over the weekend. What I'm talking about is
a complete write-up about your problem, from start to finish and the problems you encountered
and how you solved them.

Certainly I can write tidbits about the problems and how I solved them but would it make
an interesting enough blog that a complete stranger who come across my blog wants to read?
Or even worse, does it excites me enough to write about the process of building that thing?
I do not believe so.

2. Technical writing is hard. It takes a lot of effort and research to write those kind of
technical blog. And it certainly does not fit my writing style. What I want to write is
cool personal things which excite me enough to write about them. It may be an excellent article
explained everything about something I did not know about. It may be a great book that challenged
my view of the world, or me as a person being. Forcing myself to write technical blogs would
certainly burn me out.

3. My laziness certainly does not help. Initially I wanted to spend my Saturday drafting
blogs and then publish them on Sunday, but I just end up reading manga or watch anime all days
in the weekend. This is something I can certainly change, but for now I do not have a clear plan
to give up on those just yet.

## So what happens next?
I have scrapped the plan of writing weekly technical blog for now. What I will write in the future
is whatever I find interesting enough to write about them. This is a problem for the readers
because it would mean the blog would seem dead sometime. But hey, it's fine. As I have stated
in my first blog, this is now a personal blog, a hobby side project that I do. And I highly, highly
doubt that some random strangers found my blog. Hah.
